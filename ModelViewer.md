There are instructions on the usage of the navigation controls to the left of the screen.

## Shading ##
### Solid ###
The default shading method is "Solid".  In "Solid" mode, one can click the different hashed name of a mesh group and see it highlighted in red.  Ctrl+Click can deselect it if you no-longer wish to see it highlighted.

### UV ###
This will allow you to quickly visualize your model with a checkered pattern to see how the texture coordinates survived the import process.

### Textured ###
This mode is not available via S3PE.  To use this mode you need to start the program through [Texture Tweaker](http://www.den.simlogical.com/denforum/index.php?topic=625.0)
