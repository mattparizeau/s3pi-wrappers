### Moving the footprint ###
Drag the orange circle to move the entire footprint as a whole.

### Adjusting points ###
Points can be repositioned by either clicking and dragging in the preview(selected one will turn red), or using the X/Z manual input on the bottom right.

### Adding/Removing Points ###
On the bottom right there are buttons to add/remove points.  For removal, you may either select a point by its coordinates in the list, or click on it in the center preview.  The selected point will always be red so look in the preview to make sure you are deleting the right one.  Points added currently go to the end of the polygon.


### Image Background ###
You may set or clear a background image via the right-click context menu.  This can be used for reference on where to place your points.

### Mesh Background ###
This allows you to import a Sims 3 MLOD or MODL as a reference image.  It will be projected as a 2D top-down wireframe view and can be used in conjunction with an image background.
