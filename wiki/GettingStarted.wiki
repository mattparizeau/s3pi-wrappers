= Pre-requisites = 
You should at the very least have the [http://www.den.simlogical.com/denforum/index.php?topic=189.0 Sims 3 Package Editor] installed before proceeding.  Having that you must already have the .NET Framework 4.0 or above installed.  And to do much with it you should have The Sims 3 game installed as well.

= Installation =
To install, extract the files directly into your S3PE installation directory.  The archives have subfolders that will put things in the right place.  Make sure that s3pe is not running while you do this.


= Usage =
Once installed, you will have new features available to you.  There will be resources that while previously un-editable, will have the grid editor option available.  Others will have custom editor programs that can be launched by right-clicking the resource and selecting the editor.
